# ReactJS News Challenge

## Briefing
Good day ladies and gentle men, my name is <b>Chris(a random angmo)</b> and I am looking for the best developers in Singapore. I have just had a chat with your instructional team and they have assured me I am in good hands with your team. I want to be sure you are who your instructors say you are so I have this full day task to test your skills, design and logic skills.

This is your mission should you choose to accept:

Your task is to develop a news website using the news api that allows users to read the news. Your target audiences are people in Africa, Asia, Europe and of course America.

1. The site home should display headline news
1. The site to display on the home page news based on categories.i.e. sports, covid news, politics...
1. The user should be able to navigate and read news from these 4 continents from the navigation bar.
1. Since our users are in France, Nigeria & Singapore have sections to read news specifically from these countries.
1. Design is important, this is a frontend developer role. Ugly sites are no more in vogue.

Team .... dont fail me now....<br/>
I will see you on the other side.<br/>

## Helper
1. If you encounter one of the errors below, you must be trying to setState in an unmounted component. This is where `componentWillUnmount` come in. You can either use `axios.cancelToken` or set a condition to only set state if component is mounted. I have left links as to what to do in the References.
